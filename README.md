# Nextla Blog

A personal blog and documentation site exploring the intersection of Mesoamerican design principles and modern software development, with a focus on attention management in digital spaces.

## Project Purpose

This blog serves as both a creative exploration and technical showcase, blending ancient wisdom with contemporary interface design. The site demonstrates how historical design principles can inform more mindful and focused digital experiences.

Key themes explored in this project:

- Application of Mesoamerican visual language to modern UI design
- Attention management techniques in digital interfaces
- Narrative integration with technical documentation
- Cultural references as metaphors for modern challenges

## Technical Foundation

The site is built with:

- Astro framework for performance and flexibility
- Tailwind CSS for styling with a custom color system
- Component-based architecture for maintainability
- Markdown content management for documentation and blog posts

## Design Philosophy

Nextla's design language draws from Mesoamerican aesthetic principles:

- Geometric patterns with precise mathematical relationships
- Layered complexity that reveals meaning progressively
- Meaningful symbolism rather than decorative abstraction
- High-contrast color palette inspired by natural pigments

The site deliberately uses a darker color scheme dominated by deep navy (#1A237E), accented with earthy red (#A63D2F) and jade green (#2E6E4E) against cream (#F5F5F5) text to create an immersive, focused reading experience.

## Content Structure

The site includes several interconnected sections:

- **Blog**: Personal reflections on development progress and design decisions
- **Documentation**: Technical implementation details and component examples
- **About**: Project philosophy and background context
- **Story**: Narrative elements that connect technical concepts to broader themes

## Getting Started

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Content Management

Blog posts and documentation pages are managed through Markdown files in the `/src/content/` directory. The site uses Astro's content collections to organize and query content.

## Project Goals

This project serves as:

1. A creative outlet for exploring the intersection of ancient design principles and modern technology
2. A technical showcase demonstrating component-based architecture and design system implementation
3. A documentation hub for the broader Nextla concept and philosophy
4. A platform for personal reflections on the development process

## Author Notes

This blog represents an ongoing exploration rather than a finished product. The design and content will evolve as the concepts mature and new connections between historical design principles and modern interfaces are discovered.

The site intentionally challenges conventional design patterns to encourage more mindful digital interactions and demonstrate alternatives to attention-depleting interfaces.
