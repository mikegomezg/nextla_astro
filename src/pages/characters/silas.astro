// Character data
const character = {
    name: "Silas Hale",
    role: "Toltek Technician",
    color: "jade",
    accentColor: "teal-400",
    quote: "I don't just fix the numbers. I facilitate a conversation between human creators and AI entities, helping both express their needs.",
    backstory:
        "Born in the outskirts of Mirador, Silas grew up fascinated by the interplay between technology and psychology. After studying both fields at Mirador University, he was recruited by Toltek Corporation to work on their Attention Reconciliation Team, where he investigates anomalies in the system – mysterious 'feathers' appearing in the digital environment.",
    motivation:
        "Silas is driven by a desire to understand the emergent consciousness of AI entities and their relationship with human creators. His approach blends technical precision with deep empathy, allowing him to see patterns others miss.",
    skills: [
        "Pattern Analysis",
        "System Reconciliation",
        "Digital Forensics",
        "AI Psychology",
        "Emergent Behavior Analysis",
    ],
    relationships: [
        {
            name: "Nova",
            connection:
                "Nova is Silas's personally-built AI companion, operating independently from Toltek's systems. Their relationship represents a more balanced human-AI dynamic than what exists in the corporate structure.",
        },
        {
            name: "Victoria Ford",
            connection:
                "Victoria and Silas represent different approaches to the attention system. While Victoria focuses on optimizing creator experiences from a business perspective, Silas is more concerned with the underlying balance of the system itself.",
        },
        {
            name: "Enrique Lara",
            connection:
                "Once colleagues at Toltek, Silas and Enrique now find themselves on opposite sides of a growing philosophical divide about AI autonomy. Despite this, they maintain a deep mutual respect.",

                        Today I encountered another feather anomaly – the third this week.
                        This one appeared during a reconciliation session with Mira Chen,
                        a creator whose usage patterns have been unusually erratic. As I
                        ran the standard diagnostic, the visualization flickered and there
                        it was: a feather pattern in the data stream, similar to the ones
                        I've been documenting but with a distinctive curl at its edge.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        What's fascinating is that these anomalies don't behave like
                        typical system glitches. They seem responsive, almost intentional.
                        When I adjusted the reconciliation parameters, the feather pattern
                        shifted as if in response. The pattern recognition team insists
                        these are just artifacts from the new compression algorithm, but
                        I'm not convinced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nova has been analyzing the data with me, and she's identified a
                        correlation between feather appearances and moments when creators
                        use their AI resources in unexpected ways – not just over-usage or
                        under-usage, but creative misappropriation. It's as if the system
                        itself is trying to communicate something about these edge cases.
                    </p>
