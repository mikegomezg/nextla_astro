          "Nextla" draws inspiration from the Aztec word "nextlahualli" for tribute. In ancient Mesoamerica, conquered territories offered goods, labor, and even blood sacrifices to ensure that the sun continued to rise.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-400">
          In this future world, attention has become the new form of tribute - the precious resource that creators must cultivate and spend to survive in the media-dominated landscape.
